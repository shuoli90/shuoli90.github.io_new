## About Me

I am a final-year Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania under the guidance of Insup Lee and Osbert Bastani. My research is dedicated to enhancing the **safety of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)**. Currently, my work focuses on:
- Uncertainty Quantification
- Safety Alignment
- LLM for Code
- Anomaly Detection

My contributions have been recognized at ML and NLP venues, including NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, NAACL, EMNLP, and KDD. My long-term ambition is to advance the development of safe and secure ML, DL, and LLM systems. I am actively seeking job opportunities and collaborations, and I would be delighted to connect if you're interested in discussing potential opportunities.

## My Motto

> *"知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也"*  
> *"To know what you know and to acknowledge what you do not know—this is true knowledge."*
